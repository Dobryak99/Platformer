# About the project
This project is a simple 2D platformer.
The player controls a robot with artificial intelligence that was developed on an unknown planet. The planet is inhabited by many intelligent creatures that stand in the way of the game character.
The main goal of the game is to get to the main portal in order to move to another, more hospitable planet.
